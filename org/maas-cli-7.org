Now that we have some running machines, what if we just set ourselves up to SSH into one of them?  Making this work will /also/ allow us to ~scp~ files in -- and I'm sure you can see how we'd provision a machine from there.  We can also do the provisioning with MAAS, if we're clever, but I'll leave that to my next post.

First things first: we need to build the MAAS infrastructure necessary to play with this feature.

** Create a KVM

We start by creating a vm-host.  Let's play dumb and walk our way through this; first, we'll just try creating a vm-host, like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
maas admin vm-host create
#+END_SRC

This doesn't give anything like the expected result:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
usage: maas admin vm-host [-h] COMMAND ...

Manage an individual vm-host.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

drill down:
  COMMAND
    refresh   Refresh a pod
    parameters
	      Obtain pod parameters
    compose   Compose a pod machine
    add-tag   Add a tag to a pod
    remove-tag
	      Remove a tag from a pod
    read
    update    Update a specific pod
    delete    Deletes a pod

A vm-host is identified by its id.

argument COMMAND: invalid choice: 'create' (choose from 'refresh', 'parameters', 'compose', 'add-tag', 'remove-tag', 'read', 'update', 'delete')
#+END_SRC

Oops, forgot about the collective pluralism of the MAAS CLI -- we need to use ~vm-hosts~ to create one, because we're adding to the collection, so the correct command should look something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
maas admin vm-hosts create
#+END_SRC

Still not quite what we expected, but we're /failing forward fast/, which is a great way to learn new software.  As a side note, it's /not/ great for skydiving, but that's another story altogether.  The MAAS CLI tells us we need to specify a ~type~:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
{"type": ["This field is required."]}
#+END_SRC

Of course!  We have to specify what /kind/ of vm-host we want; in this case, it's going to be an LXD vm-host, so we modify our previous command like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
maas admin vm-hosts create type=lxd
#+END_SRC

Oops, still one more thing to enter: the ~power_address~:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
{"power_address": ["This field is required."]}
#+END_SRC

We need to update our command to tell MAAS what LXD instance we're going to use.  The ~power_address~ for an LXD vm-host is of the form ~https://&lt;gateway-ip-address&gt;:8443~.  The ~8443~ is the default port when you ran ~lxd init~ to get LXD started, after installing it.  The rest is just what you learn by experience, or by reading blogs like this one.

In my case, the LXD gateway is ~10.38.31.1~ at the moment, so my modified command would be:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
maas admin vm-hosts create type=lxd power_address=https://10.38.31.1:8443
#+END_SRC

Within seconds, we get a success message and JSON output.  From now on, I'll leave the JSON output for you to generate and view on your own, unless it bears specifically on the discussion.  In this case, all that we'll need is the last non-bracket line of the JSON return, which is:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
"resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/pods/7/"
#+END_SRC

What we'll need in the next step is the vm-host ID, which is the number on the end of the ~resource_uri~ -- specifically, "7".

By way of additional confirmation, we could pull up the MAAS UI and see that an LXD "KVM HOST TYPE" named "wintermute" has been created.  This might be a good moment to bring up some terminology dissonance, which is nothing unusual for an open-source product.  Originally, vm-hosts were called "pods," hence the word "pods" in the resource URI.  Later, they were changed to "KVM hosts" to correspond to the term "KVM," used commonly by ~libvirt~.  Note that ~libvirt~ was, at one time, the only common vm-host used by MAAS.  As the product transitioned to using more than one VM tool -- that is, LXD -- the team decided a more inclusive name was needed, hence "VM host."

** Composing a machine

Having a VM host is great, but we can't demonstrate ~ssh/scp~ machine actions without a virtual machine running on that host.  Let's create one.  This may get tricky, so let's start by looking at the MAAS CLI help:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
maas admin --help
#+END_SRC

This gives us the following, very long command list:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
usage: maas admin [-h] COMMAND ...

Issue commands to the MAAS region controller at http://192.168.56.91:5240/MAAS/api/2.0/.

have changed, use the command's 'refresh' sub-command to fetch the
latest version of this help information from the server.
#+END_SRC

We're looking to compose a machine here, so where would you look instinctively?  Well, the first thought might be ~machines~, so we can give that help screen a try:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
maas admin machines --help
#+END_SRC

This produces a few commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sage: maas admin machines [-h] COMMAND ...

Manage the collection of all the machines in the MAAS.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

drill down:
  COMMAND
    is-registered       MAC address registered
    set-zone            Assign nodes to a zone
    power-parameters    Get power parameters
    accept              Accept declared machines
    accept-all          Accept all declared machines
    release             Release machines
    list-allocated      List allocated

    add-chassis         Add special hardware
    clone               Clone storage and/or interface configurations
    read                List Nodes visible to the user
    create              Create a new machine
    is-action-in-progress
			MAC address of deploying or commissioning node
#+END_SRC

This list is interesting, but there isn't a specific ~compose~ command here.  We could go down the garden path with ~maas admin machines create~, but first, let's see if the vm-host command has anything we're seeking:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
maas admin vm-host --help
#+END_SRC

Bingo. Found the command; do you see it in this list?

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
usage: maas admin vm-host [-h] COMMAND ...

Manage an individual vm-host.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

drill down:
  COMMAND
    refresh   Refresh a pod
    parameters
	      Obtain pod parameters
    compose   Compose a pod machine
    add-tag   Add a tag to a pod
    remove-tag
	      Remove a tag from a pod
    read
    update    Update a specific pod
    delete    Deletes a pod

A vm-host is identified by its id.
#+END_SRC

Okay, so ~maas admin vm-host compose~ is the root command, let's see what it requires:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
maas admin vm-host compose --help
#+END_SRC

Wow! This command is /incredibly/ robust, including some NUMA stuff (which we'll look at in a later post):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
usage: maas admin vm-host compose [--help] [-d] [-k] id [data [data ...]]

Compose a pod machine


Positional arguments:

#+END_SRC

We could get fancy, but for these purposes, we just need a machine.  The only thing that's absolutely required besides the command we already got "help" for is the vm-host ID.  Remember that line of JSON from above?  The ID is "7" -- so we'll enter this command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
maas admin vm-host compose 7
#+END_SRC

Hey, how about that!  We got some feedback with a machine ~system_id~:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
Success.
Machine-readable output follows:
{
    "system_id": "xttpfx",
    "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/machines/xttpfx/"
}
#+END_SRC

We can use this, along with some of our jq tricks, to see if this machine is commissioning (as expected):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
maas admin machines read | jq -r '(["HOSTNAME","SYSID",
"POWER","STATUS","OWNER", "TAGS", "POOL","VLAN","FABRIC",
"SUBNET"] | (., map(length*"-"))),(.[] | [.hostname, .system_id, 
.power_state, .status_name, .owner // "-",.tag_names[0] // "-", 
.pool.name,.boot_interface.vlan.name,.boot_interface.vlan.fabric,
.boot_interface.links[0].subnet.name]) | @tsv' | column -t
#+END_SRC

This gives the following output on my machine:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
HOSTNAME    SYSID   POWER  STATUS   OWNER  TAGS     POOL     VLAN      FABRIC    SUBNET
--------    -----   -----  ------   -----  ----     ----     ----      ------    ------
native-cub  xttpfx  on     Testing  admin  virtual  default  untagged  fabric-1  10.38.31.0/24
#+END_SRC

By the time I got this command typed in, commissioning had already nearly finished, and the machine was in the "testing" phase.  If we run this command again now, we should see that it's in the "Ready" state:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
HOSTNAME    SYSID   POWER  STATUS  OWNER  TAGS     POOL     VLAN      FABRIC    SUBNET
--------    -----   -----  ------  -----  ----     ----     ----      ------    ------
native-cub  xttpfx  off    Ready   -      virtual  default  untagged  fabric-1  10.38.31.0/24
#+END_SRC

** Getting the machine to a login state

We can't SSH into it, because it automatically turned off after commissioning, and anyway, we didn't have a chance to ask for SSH keys to be loaded during the commissioning process.  Let's run that commissioning again, with SSH keys enabled, and making sure that it's left on after it's done.  For this operation, we just use the standard ~machine~ commands, because the vm-host is hosting a MAAS machine, which is the same as any /other/ MAAS machine:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
maas admin machine commission xttpfx enable_ssh=1
#+END_SRC

This will return a success message (be sure to substitute the "xttpfx" with whatever your composed machine ~system_id~ turns out to be; your mileage may vary).  After a little while, the machine should return to a "Ready" state again, but this time, with the power left /on/, and with SSH keys passed to the machine, so that we can login to it.  We can check this without complex jq command again:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
HOSTNAME    SYSID   POWER  STATUS  OWNER  TAGS     POOL     VLAN      FABRIC    SUBNET
--------    -----   -----  ------  -----  ----     ----     ----      ------    ------
native-cub  xttpfx  on     Ready   -      virtual  default  untagged  fabric-1  10.38.31.0/24
#+END_SRC

** Logging into a commissioned machine

So it's "Ready" and it's powered on, that's good.  In order to log in, we'll need to know the machine's IP address.  There are several ways to get this, but by far the easiest, IMHO, is just using the ~lxc~ command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
lxc list
#+END_SRC

This will give us the following output:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
+------------+---------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------+
|    NAME    |  STATE  |        IPV4         |                     IPV6                      |      TYPE       | SNAPSHOTS |
+------------+---------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------+
| first-one  | RUNNING | 10.38.31.193 (eth0) |                                               | CONTAINER       | 0         |
+------------+---------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------+
| native-cub | RUNNING | 10.38.31.202 (eth0) | fd42:fd4c:6ab9:19bc:216:3eff:fe9e:bc7b (eth0) | VIRTUAL-MACHINE | 0         |
+------------+---------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------+
#+END_SRC

This brings up some important nuances about the LXD list.  Note that there are two machines, one of which is a /CONTAINER/ that I use for general testing of new software.  The other, "native-cub," is the /VIRTUAL-MACHINE/ we just created, and that's the one whose IP address we want for SSH purposes: ~10.38.31.202~.

Okay, so now we can try logging in via SSH, using the "ubuntu" user (always):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ssh ubuntu@10.38.31.202
#+END_SRC

We get the expected first-login response:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
The authenticity of host '10.38.31.202 (10.38.31.202)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:hkKRDyRDG9JcsSmAQ0ir5jy0UKQ+PrU/FTJr36U3bvw.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
#+END_SRC

And if we say "yes," we should get this result:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
Warning: Permanently added '10.38.31.202' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

ubuntu@native-cub:~$ 
#+END_SRC

** Using SCP

We can jump out of this machine and use its IP address to copy files over to it.  First, let's make sure that there isn't anything in the local directory on the machine:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ls
#+END_SRC

And we get what we'd expect:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ubuntu@native-cub:~$ ls
ubuntu@native-cub:~$ 
#+END_SRC

So now, let's exit the machine with ~exit~, and just ~touch~ a file called "zork" (a very uncommon filename) in the CWD on the local machine:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ubuntu@native-cub:~$ exit
logout
Connection to 10.38.31.202 closed.
stormrider@wintermute:~$ touch zork
stormrider@wintermute:~$ ls

 Code           Downloads     Music     Show-n-Tell   temp~           zork
stormrider@wintermute:~$ 
#+END_SRC

Now, let's try to ~scp~ (secure copy) the file over to the machine, login, and see if the file made it:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
stormrider@wintermute:~$ scp ./zork ubuntu@10.38.31.202:
zork                                          100%    0     0.0KB/s   00:00

Cool!  So we can copy files to a machine! Neat.

** Copying files to a deployed machine

Copying files to a commissioned machine doesn't do us much good, of course, since the machine gets wiped out and reloaded on deployment.  Let's acquire and deploy that same machine, and then try logging in and copying files again.  First, we have to acquire and deploy the machine:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
maas admin machines allocate system_id=xttpfx
(Success message and JSON data stream)

maas admin machine deploy xttpfx
(Success message and JSON data stream)

maas admin machines read | jq -r '(["HOSTNAME","SYSID", 
"POWER","STATUS","OWNER", "TAGS", "POOL","VLAN","FABRIC",
"SUBNET"] | (., map(length*"-"))),(.[] | [.hostname, .system_id, 
.power_state, .status_name, .owner // "-",.tag_names[0] // "-", 
.pool.name,.boot_interface.vlan.name,.boot_interface.vlan.fabric,
.boot_interface.links[0].subnet.name]) | @tsv' | column -t

HOSTNAME    SYSID   POWER  STATUS     OWNER  TAGS     POOL     VLAN      FABRIC    SUBNET

#+END_SRC

When it finally reaches the "Deployed" state, we can try and log into it:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
stormrider@wintermute:~$ ssh ubuntu@10.38.31.2

No worries!  On deployment, the SSH key just got updated, so just do what the message suggests, and you can SSH in normally:

*** Copying a script over there and running it

So first, let's verify that the script we want to copy over there isn't /already/ there.  In fact, to keep it simple, let's just create a simple and fun script to see what ~scp~ can get us.  First, we'll need to install a couple of software packages on the deployed machine:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ubuntu@native-cub:~$ fortune

ubuntu@native-cub:~$ 
#+END_SRC

Now we can drop back and write a script that uses these three packages to produce an interesting result.  Here's what should be in the script:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/bin/bash
ddate &gt; /tmp/foo
echo '   ' &gt;&gt; /tmp/foo
fortune -s &gt;&gt; /tmp/foo
cat /tmp/foo | cowsay
#+END_SRC

Add the text above to a script called ~motd.sh~, and then ~chmod 777 motd.sh~.  Then, use the following command to copy the script to the deployed machine:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
scp ./motd.sh ubuntu@10.38.31.2:
#+END_SRC

Then we can log back into the deployed machine and check the permissions on ~motd.sh~ in the arriving CWD:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ssh ubuntu@10.38.31.2
...
ls -lsa motd.sh

ubuntu@native-cub:~$ ls -lsa motd.sh
4 -rwxrwxr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu 97 Feb  1 00:49 motd.sh
ubuntu@native-cub:~$ 
#+END_SRC

On my machine, it didn't copy the permissions precisely, but it is executable by me, so I can run it and get the highly-important output:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

** Summary

So we see that it's /possible/ to deploy a machine and then load usable software on it.  Certainly, that's one method MAAS users depend on to get their machines configured -- probably using scripts or install packages that they ~scp~ over and kick off.  There are more sophisticated ways to make this happen, and we'll cover those in a future post.  In the meantime, though, let's keep a previous promise and [[https://stormrider.io/maas-cli-8.html][try a few more jq tricks]].
